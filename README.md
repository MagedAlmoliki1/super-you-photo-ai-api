# AI Photo Generator API

This project demonstrates how to build an API that trains and generates photos using AI, featuring custom images. The API is built with FastAPI, integrates with cloud-based services, supports various image formats for AI-based photo generation, and includes support for Large Language Models (LLMs) for advanced features such as natural language image description, tagging, and more.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.13
- FastAPI (pip install "fastapi>=0.95,<0.96")
- Redis (Upstash) - Serverless Redis for async scheduling, rate limiting, caching, and more
- Generative AI model (Replicate) - Used for training and running the AI model
- Python requests (pip install requests)
- Jupyter (pip install jupyter)
- Python Decouple - To load environment variables (.env) with type casting and default values
- Model training framework (customized for fine-tuning with your images)
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** - Used for generating text-based metadata, descriptions, tags, and assisting in custom image generation commands

## Tutorial

### Build an AI Photo Generator with Python and FastAPI

Follow this guide to create an API for generating photos with AI.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Git
- VSCode (or any IDE of your choice)
- Python 3.13
- Anaconda (optional but recommended for managing environments)

### Clone this Repository

1. Open a terminal and create a project directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/dev/ai-photo-generator-api
   cd ~/dev/ai-photo-generator-api
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-photo-generator-api.git .
   ```

2. Switch to the starting branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout start
   ```

3. Make the code your own:

   ```bash
   rm -rf .git
   git init
   git add --all
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Set up AI Photo Generator API"
   ```

### Set Up Anaconda Environment

1. **Create a new Anaconda environment**:

   ```bash
   conda create --name ai-photo-generator python=3.13
   ```

2. **Activate the environment**:

   On macOS/Linux/WSL:

   ```bash
   conda activate ai-photo-generator
   ```

   On Windows:

   ```bash
   conda activate ai-photo-generator
   ```

### Install Dependencies

1. Upgrade pip:

   ```bash
   (ai-photo-generator) python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

2. Install the required packages from `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   (ai-photo-generator) python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. For support with .heic images (iPhone images), install `libheif`:

   On macOS:

   ```bash
   brew install libheif
   (ai-photo-generator) python -m pip install pillow-heif
   ```

   On Linux:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install libheif
   ```

4. For Windows, ensure you have the correct image library dependencies for `.heic` image support.

## Usage

After setting up the environment, you can start the API and begin generating photos by training the AI model or using the pre-trained versions. The LLM integration allows you to perform tasks such as generating metadata (e.g., descriptions or tags) and using natural language commands to influence image generation.

Consult the full documentation for detailed instructions on how to configure, fine-tune, and generate photos.

### Key Additions for Anaconda:
1. **Create a new Anaconda environment** with Python 3.13 using `conda create --name ai-photo-generator python=3.13`.
2. **Activate the environment** using `conda activate ai-photo-generator`.
3. Updated commands to install dependencies and run the project within the Anaconda environment.

This should provide you with the necessary steps to set up and run your project in an Anaconda environment efficiently.
